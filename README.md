📋 Features

    Export joint angles (Euler angles) from Blender armatures

    Support for multiple export formats: JSON, CSV

    Batch export of animation frames (max 100 frames by default)

    Three CSV variants for different use cases

    Automatic directory creation

    Compatible with Blender 5.0+
